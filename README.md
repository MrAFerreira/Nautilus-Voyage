# Nautilus-Voyage

## Introduction

This game was created as the first project for the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.
The theme was insipired by _20,000 Leagues Under The Sea_ and by the expeditions of James Cameron.
Using what I've learned so far the objective was to make a game using the html element Canvas and DOM manipulation. The greatest challenge however is implementing all the logic behind it, including physics, collision detection and randomization.
